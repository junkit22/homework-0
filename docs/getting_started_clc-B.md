#### Dependencies
The event trigger dependecies of the GitHub Actions workflows can be described as follows:

For the ML Python environment dependencies, the following package libraries are required as listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

#### Branching Strategies
The branching strategy adopted in this project is adapted from Trunk-based and GitFlow branching, and can be depicted as follows:

#### Feature Branch (short-lived)
The Feature branch is "short-lived" and are used by data engineers, data scietntists, application developers and cloud infra engineers for their feature-set by feature-set workstreams.

#### Main and Develop Branches (stable)
The production branch is denoted as the Main branch. Only the `Promote Tested App Image` workflow runs here that will promote a (SIT) tested `predict_buy_app` from the Develop branch to the Main branch for production release. Both the Develop and Main branches are stable branches used for Testing and Production release purposes.

The CICD pipeline workflows spanning between the Develop and Main branches is illustrated as follows:

#### Learning Journey
Some of the "little secrets" uncovered uin implementing this part of the MLOps Project are:
  - workflow_run event trigger of GitHub Actions workflows

    Originally, we wanted to make use of the event trigger of `on: workflow_run workflows: ["Train ML Model"] types: completed branches: feature*` for the `build_app` workflow, however we came to realize that:
    
      > _"This event will only trigger a workflow run if the workflow file is on the default branch."_ which happens to be the Main branch. And having to switch the GitHub default branch between Main and Feature branches was just not feasible.
      > ![gha-workflow_run_event_notes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3142eb2-30cd-444d-8156-d13dcd633d52)

    So at the end, we decided switching to using the workflow event trigger of `on: pull_request` though it was possible to use `on: workflow_call`.
