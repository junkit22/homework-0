_Q2: These are design principles for reliability in the cloud, except?_
* A: Stop guessing capacity
* B: Test recovery procedures
* **C: Start guessing capacity**
* D: Manage change in automation

_Q3: With more sophisticated automation, it’s possible to anticipate and remediate failures after they occur_
* A: True
* **B: False**

_Q4: Why we need to stop guessing capacity of a system?_
* A: With more sophisticated automation, it’s possible to anticipate and remediate failures before they occur
* B: Replace one large resource with multiple small resources to reduce the impact of a single failure
* **C: There are limits, but some quotas can be controlled and others can be managed**

_Q8: How do you monitor workload resources, except?_
* A: Monitor all components for the workload
* B: Automate responses (Real-time processing and alarming)
* C: Storage and Analytics
* **D: Conduct reviews one time only**

_Q9: How do you back up data?_
